All about me

### Bio

TODO for elxirLDN https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XzGxCxm9ZLDGohtWQbNszFx0pYpHOJ63nrjjMAUOW54/viewform

I am building an ambitious webapp for a startup 2 days a week as part of a new team. The rest of the time I am honing my skills on the latest web developments and looking for new projects

My main areas of interest are increasing the effectiveness of software delivery. I am a keen coder but also also teaching and try to blur the distinction between technical and non technical team members
