# Mind your own business View Controller

## Abstract
Elixir is different, you were told. Where other languages rely on a database, Elixir has long-lived processes. No need for dependencies to handle background tasksâ€¦ just add more processes.

This freedom can be both liberating and daunting.
To someone familiar with building MVC applications, where the database is central, how can they break old habits and get the most out of Elixir's superpowers?

In this talk we will:
- Review some universal truths of software design.
- Discuss how to use the tools we have to organise our code such as mix, umbrellas and releases.
- Show how to write cloud native applications.
- Finally ask some questions about what more the Elixir ecosystem needs to reach its full potential.

## Objectives

The objectives of this talk are twofold.
First to share some of my insights from building a variety of Elixir applications over the last 3 years. At work I am developing a payments network that makes use of HTTP streaming for server push and a persistant event log to communicate between services. This project has really broadened my horizons.
Second, I want add some clarity to some current discussions in the Elixir community.
For example statements such as "phoenix is not your application".

## Target audience

Mid to experienced developers with any level of Elixir experience.

## Bio

Working with Elixir everyday at Curl and loving it.
Discovered it after roles using Scala, Python, Ruby and JavaScript.

A regular participant in hacknights and meet-ups in London, I am always learning something new. I am keen to share my latest insights and have written and presented on the topic of Domain Driven Design. Currently I am enjoying seeing how well Docker and Elixir play together.
