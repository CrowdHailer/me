All about me

### Bio

TODO for elxirLDN https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XzGxCxm9ZLDGohtWQbNszFx0pYpHOJ63nrjjMAUOW54/viewform

I am building an ambitious webapp for a startup 2 days a week as part of a new team. The rest of the time I am honing my skills on the latest web developments and looking for new projects

My main areas of interest are increasing the effectiveness of software delivery. I am a keen coder but also also teaching and try to blur the distinction between technical and non technical team members

Currently building rich web applications at my company Workshop 14. Previously started a PhD developing components for quantum computers. Left because the real world has a much faster feedback loop. Enjoys working with Ruby, Elixir and JavaScript. p.s. also erlang, Typescript, Python, Haskell, Ocaml, Kotlin, labview, D and scala. Will take any opportunity to get immersed in the Great Outdoors.
