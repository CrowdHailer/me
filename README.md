All about me

### Bio

TODO for elxirLDN https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XzGxCxm9ZLDGohtWQbNszFx0pYpHOJ63nrjjMAUOW54/viewform

I am building an ambitious webapp for a startup 2 days a week as part of a new team. The rest of the time I am honing my skills on the latest web developments and looking for new projects


Currently building rich web applications at my company Workshop 14. Previously started a PhD developing components for quantum computers. Left because the real world has a much faster feedback loop. Enjoys working with Ruby, Elixir and JavaScript. p.s. also erlang, Typescript, Python, Haskell, Ocaml, Kotlin, labview, D and scala. Will take any opportunity to get immersed in the Great Outdoors.
Bio from skillz matter
My main areas of interest are increasing the effectiveness of software delivery. I am a keen coder but also also teaching and try to blur the distinction between technical and non technical team members
Currently working with Elixir and loving it. Don't want to neglect everything OO taught me so exploring Domain Driven Design with Elixir

Take continuous learning to heart,
Like to help others
exploring functional

I am a physics graduate and that is what helps to give me a different perspective on a lot of what is happening in the programming community at the moment. I started a Phd and was so disillusioned with the red tape, and frankly technical hindrances I encountered in the system that I left and became a programmer. My baptism of fire was at Makers Academy and I then worked as a freelance agent until becoming employed by Goodlord earlier this year.

Outside of programming, I enjoy surfing, Terry Pratchett and Dartmoor.

An able problem solver, keen to use my experience in tasks and challenges without obvious solutions. I have a wide curiosity in subjects beyond the physics education i have recieved.
