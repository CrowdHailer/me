      <h1>Reimagining the actor model</h1>
      <p>
        This is a post in which I discuss grouping system state by entities.
        These entities can live forever across multiple machines
        Prior art in the area is orleans and virtual actors
      </p>
      <h2>Back to Basics</h2>
      <p>
        The actor model consists of three rules.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create more actors</li>
        <li>Send messages to other actors</li>
        <li>Designate what to do with the next message</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What if every actor address already existed. Sending a message to an proto-actor would just activate it.
        This would reduce the number of actions an actor can do too only two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naming is hard so I will call the first kind of actors workers.
        The second entities.
      </p>
      <h2>Modelling an entity</h2>
      <pre><code class="language-elixir">
        @spec activate(message, state) :: {[{address, message}], state}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        <em>
          Pachyderm calls the combination of address and message an envelope
        </em>
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-elixir">
        @spec run([message]) :: %{address => state}
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        There are some niceties that involve init
      </p>
      <h2>The immortals</h2>
      <p>
        - What if they lived for ever failure to activate just left it at the old state.
        - This means no side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often when a machine dies our processes dies.
        In most cases we want the logic of a system to be transparent to the hardware it is running on.
        In this case the erlang process model is still to low
        The erlang process model is too low level to achive this.
        A pid is the core identity of a process and it is tied to a machine.
        The value of a pid is also generated by the machine and not the caller therefore it is not possible to recreate.
        Where the module + id is also the address it is really easy to recreate.
        A named process is one is which all the callers know the id, rather than receiving it in other messages

        e.g. Lobby "lobby", receive game address
        # TODO processes not actors
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's assume that activate is a pure function.
        In such a case an entity cannot die.
        All side effects are wrapped up in the list of envelopes returned by an activation.
        If an activation fils then the state is never return, and neither are any side effects.
        Because no effect was seen from the message received it can be assumed to have not been delivered.
        In such a case the message can be retried, perhaps after the entity has received other messages in the meantime moving it to a better state.
      </p>
      <h2>Globally unique</h2>
      <p>
        An entity works under the assumption there is only one activation at a time.
        This is the same assumption as the erlang actor model that says single thread of execution.
        However because of the states are the only thing that happens all nodes can try. then just need to agree a state
        This is an implementation of a Distributed log
      </p>
      <h2>Looking at an entity</h2>
      <pre><code class="language-elixir">
        defmodule Server do
          use Pachyderm.Entity

          def init(_id) do
            :waiting
          end

          def activate({:ping, client}, :waiting) do
            {[{client, :pong}], :pinged}
          end
        end
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        Then we need the client.
        Note init is optional
      </p>
      <p>
        In pachyderm the address of an entity is the combination of a module that implements the Entity behaviour it's kind
        and a id
      </p>
      <h2>Testing an ecosystem</h2>
      <p>
        Pachyderm calls a collection of interacting entities an ecosystem.
        There is a simulated environment that can be run and inspected in tests
      </p>
      <p>
        By applying one message at a time the simulated environment guarantees consistency of the entities.
        It does this because there are no partitions.
        The simulation can therefore only be informative about interaction of entities if the runtime ecosystem also
        provides consistency for each entity in the system
      </p>
      <p>
        - The can be exhaustive testing, will require limited message depth of some other timeout safety.
- In certain systems there will be an explosion of options but can use property testing to try a sample of them.
      </p>
      <h2>CAP</h2>
      <p>
        Pachyderm chooses consistency and extremely fine-grained sharding.
      </p>
      <p>
        ----------
      </p>
      <h2>Comparison to erlang and Elixir</h2>
      <p>
        Erlang never implemented the actor model.
        It was a pragmatic approach to a problem that has served us well.
        This makes it harder to reason about a whole system
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>loading code and changing the behaviour of all</li>
        <li>sleeping indefinetly</li>
        <li>talk to the internet</li>
        <li>they can cease to exist</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I don't imagine using Pachyderm for a whole system.
        Instead I envisage a kernel of important state that is managed by Pachyderm entities.
        The rest of the system then sends messages to, or observes, this core as necessary.
