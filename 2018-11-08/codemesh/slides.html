# Message passing for actors and humans

## **Hi**

### lets talk about,
## The **Actor** model

---
class: middle

## Actors

- **Universal** primitive of concurrent computation
- Communicate via **asynchronous** message passing
- React to messages by making **local** decisions

*First proposed by Carl Hewitt in 1973*

---
class: middle

![](/images/actor-model.png)
---
class: middle

### **Universal** primitive

- An actor has three essential elements:
  1. Processing
  2. Storage
  3. Communication
- Everything is an actor

???
https://gist.github.com/rbishop/9082539

---
class: middle

### **Asynchronous** message passing

- No guarantee of message deliver
- No guarantee of message order
- Difference with Object Oriented programming (OOP)

---
class: middle

### **Local** decisions

- No shared/global state
- In response to a message, an actor may:
  1. Create more actors
  2. Send messages to other Actors that it has addresses for
  3. Designate how the Actor is going to handle the next message it receives

The Actor gets to decide what it wants to do with incoming messages. Example: A chicken Actor doesn’t have to agree to cut off its own head.

class: middle

## In the **wild**

- Elixir
- erlang
- Akka (JVM)

---
class: middle

### Let's build our own
## in **JavaScript**

---
class: middle

### The simplest **actor**

```js
var state = 0

while (true) {
  const message = await mailbox.receive()
  state = state + 1
}
```

```js
// somewhere else
mailbox.deliver(message)
```

???
You might have a messge to stop things but we won't worry about that here
block on receive it't the only input for an actor

---
class: middle

### Blocking mailbox

```js
function Mailbox () {
  var messages = [], awaiting = undefined

  function receive () {
    return new Promise(function (resolve) {
      if (next = messages.shift()) {
        resolve(next)
      } else {
        awaiting = resolve
      }
    })
  }

  async function deliver (message) {
    messages.push(message)
    if (awaiting) {
      awaiting(messages.shift())
      awaiting = undefined
    }
  }

  return {receive: receive, deliver: deliver}
}
```

---
class: middle

### General purpose actor

```js
function init () { return 0 }

function handle (message, count) {
  return count + 1
}

var state = init()
while (true) {
  const message = await mailbox.receive()
  state = handle(message, state)
}
```

---
class: middle

### Starting actors

```js
function Actor (init, handle) {
  const mailbox = Mailbox()

  (async function run () {
    var state = init()

    while (true) {
      const message = await mailbox.receive()
      state = handle(message, state)
    }
  })()

  return {deliver: mailbox.deliver}
}
```

*Guarantees only this actor is able to receive from the mailbox*

???

third argument could be self

---
class: middle

## Actor system - **requirements**

Actors specify a concurrent program.
To run the program requires an **Actor System** that handles.

- Allocating addresses
- Delivering messages
- Scheduling actors

---
class: middle

### Actor **System**

```js
const actors = []

function start (init, handle) {
  return actors.push(Actor(init, handle)) - 1
}

async function deliver (address, message) {
  actors[address].dispatch(message)
}

ActorSystem = {start, deliver}
```

---
class: middle

## Actor system - **trade offs**

- **Concurrent** (not parallel)
- **Cooperative** (not preemtive)
- **Voluntary** (not obligatory)

---
class: middle

![](/images/concurrency-vs-parallelism.jpg)
---
class: middle

### Cooperative vs Preemtive

- **Cooperative** - processes must yield control.
- **Preemtive** - a process can be stoped at any time.


```js
const message = mailbox.receive()

// greedy process
while (true) {
  // run forever
}
```

---
class: middle

### Voluntary vs Mandatory

```js
// send a mutable message
const message = []
ActorSystem.dispatch(actor, message)

// later
message.push('surprise')
```

```js
const message = mailbox.receive()

// use global state
window.message = message
```

---
class: middle

### Example: **Ping pong**

```js
// actor behaviour
function init () { return null }

function handle ({type, address}, state) {
  if (type == 'ping') {
    ActorSystem.dispatch(address, {type: 'pong'})
  } else {
    console.log('Received Pong!')
  }
  return state
}

// run
const a1 = ActorSystem.start(init, handle)
const a2 = ActorSystem.start(init, handle)

ActorSystem.dispatch(a1, {type: 'ping', address: a2})
```

# Why?

## Where is **shared memory**

## Your **distributed** system

- High availability
- client and server
- backups failover
- multicore

Sending data ALWAYS has **latency**, and is **unreliable**.

---
class: middle

## Programming is **parallel**

> Packing huge big rocks into containers is very very difficult, but pouring sand into containers is really easy. If you think of processes like little grains of sand and you think of schedulers like big barrels that you have to fill up, filling your barrels up with sand, you can pack them very nicely, you just pour them in and it will work.

## ActorSystem2

```js
navigator.hardwareConcurrency
// 4

new Worker('./actor-system.js')
```

Left as an exercise for the **reader**.

## Abstracted communication

![](/images/envelope.jpg)

---
class: middle

---
class: middle

Many to Many relationship among Actors and Addresses.

```sh
$ dig +short google.com
216.58.204.14
```

---
class: middle

## Descriptive **side effects**

```js
var state = init()
while (true) {
  const message = await mailbox.receive()
  {outbound, state} = handle(message, state)
  outbound.forEach(doSend)
}
```

*handle can now be a totally pure function*

# HTTP is **message passing**

> The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application- level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and self-descriptive message payloads for flexible interaction with network-based hypertext information systems.

## **Mandatory** actor system

> The Erlang view of the world is that everything is a process and that processes can interact only by exchanging messages.

Let's take it further

class: middle

# GenBrowser

>  GenBrowser treats clients as just another process in one continuous, if widely distributed, system. Every client gets an address to which messages can be dispatched; and a mailbox where messages are delivered.

---
class: middle

![](/talks/2017-08-17/working-with-http2-in-elixir/http_semantics.jpg)

---
class: middle

## Joining the system

Client process are not started, but join.

```js
const client = await GenBrowser.start('http://localhost:8080')

const {address, mailbox, send, communal} = client
console.log(address)
// "g2gCZA ..."
```

---
class: middle

```elixir
{:ok, client} = GenBrowser.decode_address("g2gCZA ...")

message = %{
  "type" => "ping",
  "from" => GenBrowser.Address.new(self())
}
GenBrowser.send(client, message)

receive do
  message ->
    IO.inspect(message)
end
# => %{"type" => "pong"}

```

---
class: middle

## Aliveness

Disconnect is normal,

---
class: middle

Failure detection pinging on top

---
class: middle

Security, reconnect signed

---
class: middle

Should not be able to generate address

Signed address object capability model


There must only be one actor, explination for GenBrowser retry strategy

---
class: middle

## What's in an address

```elixir
{:via, EmailService, "bob@example.com"}
```

Send messages to virtual actors as an example of other targets

---
class: middle

Sending directly to a person

As long as it fits the model

- Person ecapsulate state and behaviour
- Communicate exclusivly via message passing

---
class: middle

## Actor model

## Humans
- primitive
- no shared state

Can be used to Model talking to a human

If  it gets the signed email address
switch on email address or text number
Have a pong link

Picture of crowds
