      <p>
        I am an experienced Elixir developer and have taken the lead in several development efforts.
        I have also delivered products in JavaScript, Ruby and Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an advocate of Domain Driven Design, referencing its methods to reliably deliver value.
        Several articles on the topic are available on my blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal projects have included: creating a webapp to look through the world, a TCP server written in Elixir and an alternative tube map for London.
      </p>
      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <hr>
      <h2>Elixir</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Language:</b> Currently my passion, I have made contributions to the core language.
        The functional paradigm and are immutable data are a natural way for me to express problems.
        The concurrency model suggests a world of possibilities that I have not seen in other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Web:</b> Have developed production web applications with Phoenix and without.
        This has given me a very valuable insight into the still young ecosystem surrounding Elixir.
        I have worked to deliver websocket API's, REST API's and dynamic sights
      </p>
      <h2>Docker</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Development:</b> Gained experience tweeking Dockerfiles and docker-compose to improve the local development experience for our multi service system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Production:</b> Familiar with the ECS service from Amazon to run dockerized systems in production.
      </p>
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Frameworks:</b> Most recently built systems that made use of Vue.js, Redux.js and Ampersand.js.
        Thorough understanding of JavaScript's prototype model.
        This allows me to work without a reliance on particular frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Testing:</b> Used Jasmine to test frontend code.
        Employ a pragmatic approach so that the cost of maintenance does not start to outweigh the benefits of testing.
      </p>
      <h2>Ruby</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Testing:</b> Experience with MiniTest and RSpec, as well as Cucumber to build a cross language test suite.
        Nurturing robust test suites has allowed me to have non-technical clients actively contributing to development.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Frameworks:</b> Worked on projects with and without Rails.
        Alternative frameworks I have used to deploy applications include Padrino and Sinatra.
        I keep up to date on the growing cohort of viable alternatives, such as Hanami and Roda.
      </p>

      <h3>Senior Software Developer</h3>
      <h4>Feb 2016 - Oct 2016</h4>
      <p>
        As one of two initial developers hired at Goodlord I was tasked with bringing an existing prototype application in house. Through the rebuild process I moved to being primarily responsible for the frontend code, a sophisticated single page web app. I had to coordinate discussions between the designer, business demands and backend team; as well as coding on a daily basis.
