      <h1>Summary</h1>
      <p>
        I am an experienced Ruby developer having lead several projects. I have also delivered projects in JavaScript and Elixir.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an a keen advocate of Domain Driven Design, believing it to be the best way to reliably deliver value. Several articles on the topic are available on my blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal efforts have included, creating a webapp to look through the world, a TCP server written in Elixir and an alternative tube map for London.
      </p>
      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <h2>Ruby</h2>
      <p>
        I have used MiniTest and RSpec, as well as Cucumber to share tests between clients in different language. Pushing test metrics is not productive, but tests should give you confidence. Having confidence in tests has allowed me to give a non-technical client access to push changes to production.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have exposure to Rails and supporting gems, such as devise. However for some projects it is over weight, so I have also deployed both Padrino and Sinatra applications. The growing cohort of viable alternatives, Hanami and roda included, is something that I have been watching with interest
      </p>
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        From the Zoo of possibilities I have built systems that made use of Vue.js, Redux.js and Ampersand.js.
        I find the prototype model in JS understandable, even elegant, and so will happily work on JS without the extra layers provided by Angular/Ember.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think frontend testing is perfectly possible, but should be conducted in a pragmatic way to ensure so that the cost does not start to outweigh the benefits. I have used Jasmine and believe it to be very similar to other options such as
      </p>
      <h2>Elixir</h2>
      <p>
        This language is currently my passion, I find immutable data and the functional paradigm very conmplementary to my way of thinking. The concurrency model suggests a world of possibilites that I have not seen in other Languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The job I had in Elixir was a translation service between different websocket API's. It was a project which would not have benifitted from Phoenix. The Phoenix web framework is something I would like to investigate further.
      </p>
      <h1>Open Source and Community</h1>
      <p>
        I keep as many side projects as possible open source. Some of the most interesting ones on my github are.

      <h1>Work History</h1>
      <h2>Goodlord</h2>
      <h3>Senior Software Developer</h3>
      <h4>Feb 2016 - Oct 2016</h4>
      <p>
        As one of two intitial hires at Goodlord I was tasked with bringing an existing prototype application in house. Through the rebuild process I moved to being primarily responsible for the front end code, a sophisticated single page web app. I had to coordinate discussions between the designer, buisness demands and backend team; as well as coding on a daily basis.

      <h2>Workshop 14 Limited</h2>
      <h3>Lead Software Developer</h3>
      <h4>May 2014 - Feb 2016</h4>
      <p>
        Web application development, in charge of technology and architecture decisions. I developed front and backend code working in conjunction with a designer. Projects used Ruby on one of several frameworks, notably Rails and Padrino. Also one project written in Elixir.
