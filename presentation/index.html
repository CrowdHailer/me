# Raxx

## An Elixir webserver interface

???
I want to talk about a library I have been developing over the past few months.

---
class: middle

# Based on Rack

Rack is a Ruby web server interface.

???
Sorry if from other languages but its my background.

---
class: middle

# But with two X's

I really like elixir.

???
Let's get started.
But there is an elephant in the room.
---
class: middle

# Plug

---
class: middle

## Ermmmm?

???
Plug is a nice library.
But reading through the source I found one problem.

---
class: middle

# Motivation

```elixir
%Plug.Conn{owner: pid} = conn
```

???
Eliminate impurity - read haskell right elixir to purge the OO
ALSO More than one implementation is healthy

---
class: middle

# Principle

> Stateless HTTP request fulfill a valuable role in modern applications and will continue to do so, this simple usecase should not be compicated by catering to more advanced communication patterns.

---
class: middle

# Simple HTTP

request -> application -> response

---
class: middle

# Simple Raxx

```elixir
defmodule MySimpleApp do
  def handle_request(_request, _env), do: Raxx.Response.ok()
end
```

??? Now this looks similar to a plug handler and it is.

---
class: middle

# Request
```elixir
%Raxx.Request{
  host: "www.example.com",
  method: "GET",
  path: ["some", "path"],
  ...
}
```

???
Just a translation of the HTTP request.
A Request object has a 1 - 1 mapping with a HTTP request.
---

class: middle
```elixir
defmodule Router do
  import Raxx.Request

  def handle_request(%{path: ["users"], method: method}, _) do
    case method do
      "GET" ->
        # Get all the users...
      "POST" ->
        # Create a user...
    end
  end

  def handle_request(request = %{path: ["api" | rest]}, env) do
    ApiRouter.handle_request(%{request | path: rest}, env)
  end
end
```

???
No routing DSL needed.
Only concession is to split the path.
Make the struct part of the API.
---
class: middle

# Response
```elixir
%Raxx.Response{
  status: 200,
  headers: %{},
  body: "hello",
  ...
}
```

---
class: middle

```elixir
defmodule FooRouter do
  alias Raxx.Response
  def handle_request(%{path: ["users"], method: "GET"}, _) do
    %{status: 200, body: "All users: Andy, Bethany, Clive"}
  end

  def handle_request(%{path: ["users"], method: "POST", body: data}, _) do
    case MyApp.create_user(data) do
      {:ok, user} ->
        Response.created("New user #{user}")
      {:error, :already_exists} ->
        Response.conflict("sorry")
      {:error, :bad_params} ->
        Response.bad_request("sorry")
      {:error, _unknown} ->
        Response.internal_server_error("Well that's weird")
    end
  end

  def handle_request(%{path: ["users"], method: _}, _) do
    Response.method_not_allowed("Don't do that")
  end
end
```

???
Helpers just for the purpose of generating responses.

Talk about umbrella apps.
Talk about debugger page and the fact that if the error is within the application write a new test which ignores the webstack.
---
class: middle

# But ...

---
class: middle

# Streaming

---
class: middle

```elixir
defmodule StreamingApp do
  alias Raxx.Response
  alias Raxx.ServerSentEvents, as: SSE


  def handle_request(%{path: ["events"]}, %{channel: channel}) do
    :ok = MyApp.subscribe(channel, self())
    SSE.upgrade(__MODULE__, :no_state)
  end

  def handle_info({:update, message}, _) do
    {:send, message}
  end
  def handle_info(_, _) do
    :nosend
  end

end
```

???
Expand the communication protocol without impacting on the simplicity of response only.

TODO
Streaming in, and websockets.
Integrations. Elli, Cowboy, mochiweb and Ace.

???
All comments well recieved.

As an experiment I am trying to develop this as a learning process rather than a thing which has to be highly effecient.
I am also build a web server in the same educational vein. So please get in touch.

Thank you very much.
