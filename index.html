    <p>
      This is my new blog and I am dedicated to developing it in a way new to me.
      The guiding principle for this site is that there will be no hidden drafts.
      The page in front of you (my, hypothetical at the moment, audience) will be the same page as the last commit.
      Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/me">source code</a>, call me out if it's not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      New technologies will only be added if they are clearly valuable additions.
      At present this site follows the excellent design guidelines over at <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this fruity website</a>.
      The styling will evolve and improve over time, perhaps, but it will never get in the way of delivering content.
    </p>

      This is my antidote to the <a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/07/15/overcoming-javascript-framework-fatigue.html">hype cycle</a>.
      <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple should be easier</a>.
      So here's to writing <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Programming-Sucks!-Or-At-Least%2c-It-Ought-To-">boring code</a>.
