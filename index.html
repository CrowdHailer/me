    <h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
      My background is physics- I have an MPhys from Oxford and started a Phd in Scotland following some travelling.
      I found the Phd was not well suited to me and I left to find faster feedback in the real world.
      An intense introduction to Ruby on the Makers Academy 3 month coding course was the change of direction I needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't looked back.
      I freelanced immediately after graduating Makers, working on projects involving Ruby, JavaScript and Elixir.
      Recently I have been working at a proptech start-up as a senior developer, this time with Scala.
    </p>
    <p>
      A regular participant in hacknights and meet-ups in London I am always learning something new.
      I am keen to share my latest insights and have written and presented on the topic of Domain Driven Design.
      Currently I am enjoying seeing how DDD concepts merge with the rigor of functional languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary aim is to become a software craftsman and to build the future of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of programming, I enjoy surfing, Terry Pratchett and Dartmoor.

    <h2>Building with domain concepts</h2>
    <p>
      All useful software is applied to a particular problem domain. This talk will encourage the use of value objects to better model a programs problem domain.

    <h1>Starting Something</h1>
    <p>
      This is my new blog and I am dedicated to developing it in a way new to me.
      The guiding principle for this site is that there will be no hidden drafts.
      The page in front of you (my, hypothetical at the moment, audience) will be the same page as the last commit.
      Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/me">source code</a>, call me out if it's not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      New technologies will only be added if they are clearly valuable additions.
      At present this site follows the excellent design guidelines over at <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this fruity website</a>.
      The styling will evolve and improve over time, perhaps, but it will never get in the way of delivering content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my antidote to the <a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/07/15/overcoming-javascript-framework-fatigue.html">hype cycle</a>.
      <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple should be easier</a>.
      So here's to writing <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Programming-Sucks!-Or-At-Least%2c-It-Ought-To-">boring code</a>.
