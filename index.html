      I have an Master of Physics (MPhys) from Oxford and started a Phd in Scotland following some travelling.
      I found the Phd was not well suited to me and I left to find faster feedback in the real world.
      An intense introduction to Ruby on the Makers Academy 3 month coding course was the change of direction I needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven't looked back.
      I freelanced immediately after graduating Makers, working on projects involving Ruby, JavaScript and Elixir.
      Recently I have been working at a proptech start-up as a senior developer, this time with Scala.
    </p>
    <p>
      A regular participant in hacknights and meet-ups in London I am always learning something new.
      I am keen to share my latest insights and have written and presented on the topic of Domain Driven Design.
      Currently I am enjoying seeing how DDD concepts merge with the rigor of functional languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary aim is to become a software craftsman and to build the future of the web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of programming, I enjoy surfing, Terry Pratchett and Dartmoor.

    <h1>New Mission</h1>
    <p>
      Last year I wrote extensively about <a href="http://insights.workshop14.io/2015/07/14/domain-driven-design-introduction.html">Domain Driven Design</a>.
      This was driven by a desire to make programs that delivered the most value possible.
      On the whole this was a great success.
      In several cases allowing me to solve problems with much less code than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2016, The most outstanding issue is making my applications cloud native.
      We all know about docker and it's place in immutable infrastructure movement.
      The elephant in the room seams to be storing state in this new model.
      Therefore my next goal is to understand and exploit distributed data storage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been a fan of Elixir/Erlang for a while now and been experimenting with them as much as possible in my free time.
      This has been a great platform to learn about distributed programming, as well as being <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/myelixirstatus">hugly rewarding</a>.
      The erlang process model is a really well thought through way to tackle concurrent programming.
      I would recommend <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024149.do">Designing for Scalability with Erlang/OTP</a> for anyone wanting to see the extend of what is possible here.
    </p>
    <p>
      However to really understand distributed data storage requires a solid appreciation of the theory.
      It will also require a much greater understanding of infrastructure considerations than knowing how to use heroku.
      Vagrant is an interesting technology but as containers come to promenance over virtual machines learning about kuberneties and docker seams important.
      Or maybe not, I have no idea if containers are required if one understands erlangs releases properly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is the most relevant work in this area being done at the moment?
      Currently I am looking at <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>, <a href="https://lasp-lang.org/">LASP</a> and <a href="http://hood.ie/">hood.ie</a>, but I am sure I have missed some.
      If anyone else is tackling this problem it would be great to hear about it.
      For everyone else interested in the theory and execution of distributed data storage stay posted.

    <h1>Starting Something</h1>
    <p>
      This is my new blog and I am dedicated to developing it in a way new to me.
      The guiding principle for this site is that there will be no hidden drafts.
      The page in front of you (my, hypothetical at the moment, audience) will be the same page as the last commit.
      Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/me">source code</a>, call me out if it's not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      New technologies will only be added if they are clearly valuable additions.
      At present this site follows the excellent design guidelines over at <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this fruity website</a>.
      The styling will evolve and improve over time, perhaps, but it will never get in the way of delivering content.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is my antidote to the <a href="http://teropa.info/blog/2015/07/15/overcoming-javascript-framework-fatigue.html">hype cycle</a>.
      <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">Simple should be easier</a>.
      So here's to writing <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/Programming-Sucks!-Or-At-Least%2c-It-Ought-To-">boring code</a>.
