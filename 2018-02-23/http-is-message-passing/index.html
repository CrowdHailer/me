    <h1>HTTP is message passing</h1>
    <h2>Or - Why I stopped using Plug</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        In conclusion, Plug is not idiomatic Elixir (or erlang) because of its impure interface.
        My solution is a pure interface called <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/raxx">Raxx</a>.

      HTTP describes communication between clients and servers via the web.
      Below is a quote from the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-1">rfc7230</a> introduction.
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-1">
      The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
      level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
      self-descriptive message payloads for flexible interaction with
      network-based hypertext information systems.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This introduction describes both requests and responses as messages.
      Communication between web endpoints is therefore a system using message passing.
    </p>
    <h2>GenServer</h2>
    <p>
      Message passing is a completley natural concept to Elixir.
      OTP even provides an idiomatic way to build servers, using the <code>GenServer</code> module.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a simple <code>GenServer</code> implementation that will send a response to a client request message.
      In this example the client is just another beam process.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-elixir">
      defmodule MyServer do
        use GenServer

        def handle_call(:request, _from, state) do
          {:reply, :response, state}
        end
      end
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Raxx.Server</h2>
    <p>
      <code>Raxx.Server</code> is designed for idiomatic handling of request and response messages.
      The only difference is the messages are from a web client instead of beam process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is a simple <code>Raxx.Server</code> implementation.
      You can see the similarities to the <code>GenServer</code> example.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-elixir">
      defmodule MyApp do
        use Raxx.Server

        def handle_request(_request, _state) do
          response(:ok)
        end
      end
    </code></pre>
    There are a few differences between the implementations that reflect the differences between sending messages over the web and within the beam vm.
    <ul>
      <li>
        A <code>Raxx.Server</code> is started for each request;
        therefore <code>handle_request</code> is the first function called and an <code>init</code> callback is not required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each HTTP message exchange is isolated to its own process;
        there is no need for a <code>from</code> argument to be passed to <code>handle_request</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is no need to return a new state in <code>Raxx.Server</code> implementation,
        the process is terminated as soon as the reponse is sent.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What about streaming</h2>
    <p>
      One of the design goals for Plug was to accomodate streaming.
      This was an argument against interfaces like <a href="http://rack.github.io/">Rack</a>, where a complete request or response would need to be loaded into memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raxx is loosely based on Rack but does not have these drawbacks.
      Streaming can be managed in an efficient manner using other callbacks available on <code>Raxx.Server</code>, see the <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/raxx#streaming">docs</a> for details.
    </p>
    <h2>The Raxx toolkit</h2>
    <p>
      Raxx is a toolkit for refined web development.
      It is currently used in production by several companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the core of the project are data structures for <code>Raxx.Request</code> and <code>Raxx.Response</code>.
      Both are pure data structures which means that they contain no references to processes.
      This is different to <code>Plug.Conn</code> which does contain a process.
      This process is the source of odd behaviour such as only being able to read the body once.
    </p>
    <p>
      A server is needed to run any web application.
      <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/Ace"><code>Ace</code></a> is the first server to run raxx applications and has support for HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several common components are part of the core libray such as <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/raxx/Raxx.Router.html#content"><code>Raxx.Router</code></a> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/raxx/0.14.9/Raxx.Logger.html#content"><code>Raxx.Logger</code></a>.
      More are available in other projects such as <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/raxx_api_blueprint"><code>Raxx.APIBlueprint</code></a> for a documented router
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there is <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/raxx_kit"><code>Raxx.Kit</code></a>.
      It is the quickest way to get started with Raxx. This project consists of generators to set up a project with sensible defaults,
      as well as the Ace server for your application.
