## Raxx - Refined web development

### Talk Abstract

Raxx can be used to build web applications much like Plug. However that is where the similarities end. Raxx aims to simplify web applications by promoting simple concepts like functional purity and message passing.

I started the project in 2016. Since then, it has matured to the point where it has been used in several production services. This talk will cover an introduction to the project; an overview of the rationale behind it, and finally a vision of what comes next.

### Talk TLDR

Functional purity matters, even in languages that accept impurity such as Elixir.

## Building a webserver in Elixir

### Talk Abstract

Elixir's lightweight processes are its secret sauce and give the language a unique set of strengths.

This talk explores the virtues of Elixir processes and demonstrates how to work with them.
Also covered is OTP and the conventions it provides to make developing with processes a joy.
Finally we will take a deeper dive into a real world example; constructing a capable webserver.

### Talk TLDR

Lightweight processes are Elixir's superpower, learn how to put them to work.

## Mind your own business View Controller

### Talk Abstract

Many applications are a perfect fit for Model View Controller(MVC).
There are also many applications where MVC is not suitable.
In both cases Elixir is a great choice.
This talk will be a guide for alternative architectures e.g Hexagonal/Onion/Clean.

In this talk I want to:
Review some ideas of designing software. What separation of concerns really means.
Discuss how to use the tools we have to organise our code such as mix, umbrellas and releases.
Finally ask some questions about what more the Elixir ecosystem needs to reach its potential.

### Talk TLDR

"The framework is not your application", ok so what is?
