True but often they will try and add a call to action, upgrade or buy the latest.
In most cases a question box saying do you want to upgrade would not be suble enough.
Senders might not want to surface that

<!-- intro 1 -->
While working on Plum Mail I have been asking people how they use there emails and the problems they have.
One issue that comes up regularly questions in messages are ignored or not clearly answered.

<!-- intro 2 -->

Many people complain that email is broken in some way.
Much of the time the purpose of an email is not simply to read it.
Can exploring the questions above help us understand the purpose of the messages we receive.
And can that insights help with building a better communication platform?

<!-- intro 1 is better -->

## What kinds of questions do we ask

- Can we have a call tomo (Fact, but rather implicit)
- What is the password
- What is your feedback on the new design?
- How was your weekend?

We're going to group these questions into four categories

#### Fact gathering

These are the wh-questions

These questions require one answer.
In a group conversation only one person needs to answer.

Not everyone can answer this question.
"I don't know" leaves the question unanswered

It is also possible to

#### Opinion gathering

These are normally fairly open ended questions.
In a group conversation potentially everyone can answer.
Everyone receiving this question can answer, for example "I don't know" does answer the question.

#### Task assignment

Can you order paperclips

The answer to this question is not "no" nor is it "yes I have received the training".
This questions value is not in the answer but that task gets occumplished outside of the conversation.

It is possible for these questions to be rephrased as a decree "Order the paperclips".
This is not often used in messages I send or receive, possibly because it comes across as unnecssarily aggressive.

#### Pleasantries

How was your weekend?

The purpose of a question like this is often for the human touch.
If I receive an answer that will be nice, however it doesn't matter if this question remains unanswered.

## Optionality

Do you have any feedback on the new design?

A variation on the opinion gathering question.
This one leaves space for no answer and has two problems.

- Often there is an implicit assumption that an answer should be provided
- There is no way to tell if someone is not answering because the don't have an opinion, or has not answered yet.

<!-- ## Messages without Question -->
## The Question is the Task

All of these questions have different expectations around what the answer should be,
however apart from pleasantries all of them do expect an answer.

Should a message without a question or answer even be sent?

The purpose of every valuable message sent is to ask or answer a question.
I believe this holds in a professional environment, and potentially in a personal one too.

In fact I would go as far as saying if there is no question or answer in a email I do not want to receive it.
And I would aim not to send any.

### Messages without a question



## When to reply

Another big problem is reply expectations
if we make questions a task, then the sender can see if I have accepted to answer it.
