> Phoenix is a web development framework written in Elixir which implements the server-side Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience in other web frameworks **like Ruby on Rails or Python's Django.**
???

Some what flippant, but also they should stop defining themself by association

- Supports evolving requirements
- Can be validated (Predictable/Testable)

# Domain Driven Design

### Discover design don't choose it.

---
class: middle

## **Domain**

- A coherent subset of the whole universe.

---
class: middle

## **Model**

- A useful representation of a domain

---
class: middle

## **Ubiquitous language**

- Terms used to describe concepts in the domain, and model

---
class: middle

## **Context**

- Understand the limit of the model.

???
  The concept of a passenger is very different to an aerospace engineer and flight attendant.

# Tactics

class: middle


## **Value object**

- Any object whose identity is characterized by its attributes.

- They should be treated as immutable

---
class: middle

```elixir
address = {"create", "duck", "chip"}
```

![](w3w-london.png)
*https://w3w.co/create.duck.chip*

---
class: middle

## **Entity**

- Concept that is defined by it's identity
- Their state can evolve over time

---
class: middle

```elixir
order = %{
  id: 1,
  status: :dispatched,
  address: {"create", "duck", "chip"}
}
```

## **Ports**

```elixir
defmodule NotificationService do
  @callback alert(User.t(), String.t()) :: {:ok, integer} | {:error, term}
end
```

## and **Adapters**

```elixir
defmodule NotificationService.SMS do
  @behaviour NotificationService

  @impl NotificationService
  def alert(user, message) do
    # Send some SMS's
  end
end
```

## All models are **wrong**

> Since all models are wrong the scientist cannot obtain a "correct" one by excessive elaboration. On the contrary following William of Occam he should seek an economical description of natural phenomena. Just as the ability to devise simple but evocative models is the signature of the great scientist so overelaboration and overparameterization is often the mark of mediocrity.

---
class: middle

## Protect the **model**

- use ports to obscure infrastructure details
- Start from lib
- Delay descisions about which exciting NoSQL DB is best

---
class: middle

## Functional cohesion

> Functional cohesion is when parts (of a module) are grouped because they all contribute to a single well-defined task

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science))

---
class: middle

## Tests are **just** an adapter

By having well defined ports into the domain clear testing points are available.

class: middle

## Know your **Limits**

Understand the bounds of your context

## MVC Frameworks
```
lib/
├── models/
├── views/
├── controllers/
```

**Not** Phoenix


---
class: middle


```eex
<%= form_for @changeset, user_path(@conn, :create), fn f -> %>
  <label>
    Name: <%= text_input f, :name %>
  </label>

  <%= submit "Submit" %>
<% end %>
```

Model !!! it's a form validator and a DB row.
