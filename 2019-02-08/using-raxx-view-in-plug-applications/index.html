    <h1>Using Raxx.View in Plug applications</h1>
    <p>
      There are <a href="https://medium.com/@a4word/building-small-elixir-services-using-ecto-without-phoenix-1aba00b53e54">several</a>
      <a href="https://blog.lelonek.me/minimal-elixir-http2-server-64188d0c1f3a">articles</a> explaining the value of creating applications with just Plug,
      when you don't require all the trappings of a batteries included framework.
      One common example is a small API service.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens though when your simple application requires a single dashboard page?
      Or for some other reason you want to show a bit of HTML?
      This is where <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/raxx_view">Raxx.View</a> comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/raxx">Raxx</a> is a web toolkit.
      It consists of a simple interface and a selection of powerful yet focused libraries.
      Each one is built to ease a particular element of developing web applications.
      Raxx.View is one of these libraries and, despite the name, is just as useful in a Plug application.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        Not interested in piecing together your own framework?
        Try <a href="https://github.com/crowdhailer/raxx_kit">Raxx.Kit</a> which makes starting a new project as simple as two commands:
      </em>
      <pre><code class="language-elixir">
        $ mix archive.install hex raxx_kit
        $ mix raxx.kit my_app
      </code></pre>
      <em>
        Now, back to those Plug applications.
      </em>
    </p>
    <h2>Defining views</h2>
    <p>
      Below is the example taken from the Raxx.View <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/raxx_view/readme.html">documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-elixir">
      defmodule MyApp.ListUsers do
        use Raxx.View,
          arguments: [:users, :title],
          template: "list_users.html.eex",
          layout: "layout.html.eex"
      end
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      This is a simple example and the library has support generating helpers, partials and layouts.
      It also helps with reusing any of these components across multiple views.
      For full details see the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/raxx_view/readme.html">documentation</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Rendering views</h2>
    <p>
      Using <code class="language-elixir">Raxx.View</code> in the module above generated a <code class="language-elixir">html/2</code> function.
      This function takes users as the first argument and a title as the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The module <code class="language-elixir">MyApp.ListUsers</code> is now a view.
      Let's add the callbacks required to make it a Plug as well.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-elixir">
      defmodule MyApp.ListUsers do
        import Plug.Conn

        use Raxx.View,
          arguments: [:users, :title],
          template: "list_users.html.eex",
          layout: "layout.html.eex"

        def init(options) do
          options
        end

        def call(conn, _opts) do
          users = [] # need to fetch users somehow
          title = "Users Admin"

          conn
          |> put_resp_content_type("text/html")
          |> send_resp(200, html(users, title))
        end
      end
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      <em>
        It is also possible to keep the view and controller as separate modules.
      </em>
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-elixir">
      defmodule MyApp.ListUsersView do
        use Raxx.View, arguments: [:users, :title], # ... rest
      end

      defmodule MyApp.ListUsersController do
        # ... rest
        def call(conn, _opts) do
          users = [] # need to fetch users somehow
          title = "Users Admin"

          conn
          |> put_resp_content_type("text/html")
          |> send_resp(200, MyApp.ListUsersView.html(users, title))
        end
      end
    </code></pre>
    <p>
      And that's everything, which demonstrates that bringing together these two libraries is simple.
      It also enables a nice third way between a full framework like Phoenix and rolling your own on top of Plug.
    </p>
    <h2>A web toolkit?</h2>
    <p>
      In my opinion this is a nice example of a focused library being reusable.
      Perhaps unsurprisingly Raxx.View works as well in a Raxx application as it does in a Plug one,
      maybe even a Phoenix one but I am yet to try that.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the process of building several web tools it has become obvious that many of these tools can be agnostic to the users' framework choices.
      So far there is <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/basic_authentication">BasicAuthentication</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/cors">CORS</a>.
      If you want to help develop these, or are starting your own part of the web toolkit, I'm always keen to hear about it.
