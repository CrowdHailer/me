## Problems with online communication

Email is ubiquitous yet many, many people hate it, why?
Asking around these are the main problems we have with email:

1. No expectation about how quickly an email needs responding too, if at all.
1. Email Ping pong, sending several small messages for a conversation that would have taken 5 minutes on the phone.
1. Marking emails as unread is a poor approximation for a todo list.
1. Conversations with multiple participants rely on hitting reply all, not reply.
1. New people can only be added by to a thread by sending a message and will fall off if someone replies to an old message.
1. No way to leave an email thread.
1. Every message is jumbled together not separated by importance.
1. Messages too bump a conversation to the top of your inbox messages.
1. Bad formatting, individuals send no formatting, or random formatting if text is copy/pasted.
1. Too much formatting, companies send unnecessarily huge pictures in the name of branding
1. Attachments have no link to the latest version of a document, easy to pass around outdated versions.
1. Receiving too many messages.
1. The cc problem, being added to a conversation to be "looped in" which just increases the number of messages
1. Checking email all the time, even when not expecting anything.
1. Loosing decisions made in long threads.


<!-- 1. Inboxes are not always/reliably grouped by the subject of the conversation, it also relies on participants not modifying the subject line. -->
1. Attachments, or embedded content in IM, go stale and there is no way to link versions of the same attachment together.
1. (Email/IM) inboxes/notifications can become overloaded if users do not manage them.
1. (Email/IM) are much slower forms of communication than video calls.
1. (Email/IM) conversations lack structure, it is hard to reach consensus and find conclusions.
1. Humans are incentivised to look at their inboxes, even when not expecting messages because random rewards (sometimes there is a message sometimes not) have a strong dopamine response
1. (IM) features like "x is typing" encourage more engagement (wasted time) within an application.


This list is a result of working on trying to "fix email".
I don't know which of these problems can be solved by technology.
However, if you want to hear more about efforts to improve the situation get in touch via twitter or email

A few of these problems can be fixed by being organised

1. (IM) It is not possible to have more than one conversation topic with the same set of participants.
1. (Forums) It is impossible to chat to people who are not members of a specific, normally special interest, forum.
1. (IM) To send someone a message you must be on the same platform no standard address format that works across providers, i.e. no email address

### No conversation structure

> Re: Re: Re: Re: No Topic

Email is just messages there is no


1. Please make sure to hit reply-all
2. Just wanted to bump this message to the top of your inbox
3. Mark as unread
4. I have CC'd Bill to "loop them in"
5. Re: Re: Re: Re: No Topic
6. Please don't

- Conversation structure even simple reply response is not enforced
  1. It's possible to reply to old messages in a thread
  1. Changing a subject can split a thread

- No way to manage participants in conversations with multiple people
  1. They rely on hitting reply all, not reply.
  2. New people can only be added by sending a message and will fall off if someone replies to an old message.
  3. It's hard to leave a big conversation group

- Inbox is open
  - Anyone can send you a message
  Bump to top of inbox.
