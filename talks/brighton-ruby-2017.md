## Abstract

Elixir is one among many new languages, so why give it your attention? For me it was the ability to do one thing I found hard in Ruby; writing concurrent code. Elixir makes writing massively concurrent programs easy and enjoyable. It manages this and has the best of Ruby, keeping developers happy.

Get started with the basics of writing concurrent programs in Elixir.
Explore some of the impressive properties of processes, the core building block of Elixir.
Finally walk through building a webserver to see the real value to mastering concurrent programming.

# For Reviewers

## Details

The out line of the talk is.

1. Overview of working with processes
2. The properties of processes
3. Failure handling between processes
4. Finally a birdseye view of how you could set work with those to make a server.

## Pitch

I have seen several welcome to Elixir talks in a Ruby context.
They have all started talking about the syntax, functional programming and immutability.
Because Ruby is able to handle a functional style so well, these talks never provided me with a compelling reason to visit Elixir.

By showing the process model, this talk demonstrates a capability the Ruby programmers would have had to work hard to match. This also explains why Elixir is distinct from other functional languages.

I should give this talk because

- I built a [webserver](https://github.com/CrowdHailer/Ace) in Elixir, to teach myself about processes.
- I have already talked about it at ElixirLDN, a similar talk but at a different level.

## Bio

Currently writing snazzy software with Elixir as a day Job. I relish tackling hard problems, my current favourites are around distributed timelines. Outside of programming, I enjoy surfing, the books of Terry Pratchett and trekking around some countryside.
