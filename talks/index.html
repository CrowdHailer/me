    <h1>Talks</h1>
    <p>
      Here you can find the talks that I have presented.
      They are included along with slides and, where available, recordings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domain Driven Design (DDD), Elixir/erlang and causality are all facinating topics, that I hope to talk about in the future.
      Prepared talks that I have yet to present can be found at the bottom of this page.

      <h1>Introducing Raxx, an Elixir Webserver Interface</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/raxx">Raxx</a> is a personal project investigating the value of a [rack]() style interface to the Elixir ecosystem.
        This talk is quick overview of why I undertook the project and some thoughts on progress at the time.

      <h1>Building with domain concepts</h1>
      <p>
        All useful software is applied to a particular problem domain. This talk will encourage the use of value objects to better model a programs problem domain.

      <h1>Ace an Education in TCP</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/CrowdHailer/ace">Ace</a> is a TCP server that was built with the design priority of having welcoming source code.
        I wanted to learn more about the network layer and how to work with erlang/OTP.
      </p>
      <p>
        This talk shows the path from simple echo functionality to a robust general purpose server.
        The challenges and encountered along the way.
        And why Elxir was such a perfect fit for this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may also be possible to present this or similar as an more technical introduction to why BEAM to other communities.

      <h1>Application border control</h1>
      <p>
        Lets build programs that express the problem domain.
        This is one of the best ideas from Domain Driven Design.
        However how to we have a progam composed of rich objects that make use of libraries that don't have the same semantics.
        How do we prevent our application from getting bogged down in implementation details.
        This talk discusses the above and in particular tackles the most pernicious implementation detail of HTTP servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many ways this is the extension of "building on domain concepts", although all necesary ground about value objects is covered.

      <h1>Rails the library</h1>
      <p>
        Rails is part of your toolkit and yet it makes a lot of demands for your time.
        Not just building a CRUD application?
        This talk discusses putting Rails in the corner and letting your application be more than a Rails app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The content of this talk is based on production applications that have followed this approach.
        The guidance for the development was from the ideas of bounded contexts and pluggable services from Domain Driven Design

      <h1>Object Oriented programming, One more time.</h1>
      <p>
        Spoiler: Objects come in two flavours, Facts and Actors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functional Programming(FP) and Object Oriented Programming(OOP) are often presented as opposites.
        Alan Kay doesn't mention classes and yet these are the first part of any tutorial on OOP.
        Joe Armstrong the creator of erlang, a clearly functional language, describes it as perhaps the only object oriented language.
      </p>
      <p>
        This talk tries to clear up some of the many issues around OOP.
        OOP makes everything an object.
        I will argue this is a valid and yet useless.
        By getting more specific about the types of objects that exist we reconcile our difference and move on to a glorious future, perhaps.
